# 🎨 Portfolio V2

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my journey as a web developer, featuring my projects, skills, and progress.

## 🚀 About the Project
This portfolio is built to demonstrate my improved skills in:
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: With modern animations and responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements like Matrix rain and stats counters.
- **Design**: A "Cyber-Yellow" aesthetic with a terminal vibe.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main entry point structure.
- `styles.css`: Custom styling with CSS variables and flex/grid layouts.
- `script.js`: Dynamic behaviors using vanilla JavaScript.
- `PROGRESS_LOG.md`: A tracked log of my learning milestones (Synced to my learning-programming repo!).
